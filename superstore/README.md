# ðŸ“Š Sprint 4: Data Visualization with Tableau â€“ Superstore Profitability Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project involved using **Tableau** to create interactive dashboards and visualizations for a fictional **Superstore** dataset.  
The objective was to analyze **profitability trends, advertising opportunities, and return rates** to help the store avoid bankruptcy and increase profits.

## âœ… Business Objective
The Superstore is experiencing profitability issues. As a consultant, I was tasked to:
1. Identify **major profit centers** and **loss-making segments**.
2. Recommend **products and subcategories to promote or discontinue**.
3. Assess **advertising potential** across states and months.
4. Analyze **return rates** and their impact on revenue.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The project used the **Superstore.xls** dataset, which included:
- **Orders Table**: Order details, product info, sales, profit, and shipping.
- **Returns Table**: Product return status for each order.

### **Part 2: Advertising Opportunities**
- Selected **3 states and best months for advertising** based on:
  - Average monthly profit trends.
  - ROI assumption: willingness to spend **1/5 of profits** on ads.
- Created **seasonal profit trend charts** for these states.

### **Part 3: Returned Items Analysis**
- Created a calculated field for **Returned**:  
  - Yes â†’ 1  
  - Null â†’ 0  
- Analyzed:
  - Products with **highest return rates**.
  - Customers with frequent returns.
- Visualized:
  - **Profit vs. Return Rate** by dimension (State, Shipping Mode, etc.).
- Recommended discontinuation of **high-return, low-profit segments**.

## ðŸ“Š Tools & Techniques
- **Tool:** Tableau
- **Skills Demonstrated:**
  - Data joins (**LEFT JOIN** Orders with Returns).
  - **Calculated fields** for return rate.
  - Comparative and trend analysis.
  - Dashboard design for executive decision-making.
